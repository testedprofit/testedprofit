                <h1>The Dalton Trumbo Statue: Grand Junction's Tribute to a Rebel Genius</h1>
            </header>

            <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0615/6913/8747/files/james_dalton_trumbo.png?v=1750716341"
                 alt="Photograph of Dalton Trumbo writing in his bathtub, which inspired the statue."
                 class="content-image"
                 onerror="this.style.display='none'">

            <p>Nestled on Main Street in Grand Junction, Colorado, is one of the most unique and thought-provoking public sculptures in the United States: a life-sized statue of Academy Award-winning screenwriter <strong>Dalton Trumbo</strong> writing in his bathtub. This monument is more than just a piece of art; it's a tribute to a local hero, a symbol of artistic integrity, and a permanent reminder of a dark chapter in American history.</p>

            <section id="the-statue">
                <h2>About the Sculpture: A Bronze Bathtub of Creativity</h2>
                <p>The statue masterfully captures the eccentric and dedicated nature of Dalton Trumbo. It depicts him reclined in a bathtub, not for bathing, but as his preferred workspace. A writing board rests over the tub, with a coffee cup and a cigarette nearby—his known creative companions.</p>

                <h3>A Unique Depiction</h3>
                <p>This striking image is based on a real 1967 photograph. Trumbo famously worked in the tub to soothe chronic back pain, allowing him to write for hours on end. The sculpture, created by artist <strong>J. Michael Wilson</strong>, brings this intimate moment of creative genius to public life. It was installed in September 2007 as a cornerstone of the "Legends of the Grand Valley" sculpture project, a community effort to honor influential local figures.</p>

                <h3>Community and Recognition</h3>
                <p>The statue's creation was spearheaded by the Dalton Trumbo Historical Recognition Committee, affectionately known as "The Dalton Gang." Through fundraising and the support of numerous local sponsors, they successfully established this lasting tribute to a man who was once ostracized for his beliefs.</p>

                <h2>Who Was Dalton Trumbo? From Grand Junction to Hollywood</h2>
                <p>James Dalton Trumbo was born in Montrose, Colorado, in 1905 and spent his formative years in Grand Junction. His journey from a small Colorado town to the pinnacle of Hollywood success—and subsequent public fall from grace—is a story of immense talent, conviction, and resilience.</p>

                <h3>Literary and Screenwriting Career</h3>
                <p>Trumbo was a prolific and gifted writer. He authored several novels, including the poignant anti-war book <em>Johnny Got His Gun</em>. In Hollywood, he became one of the industry's highest-paid screenwriters, penning scripts for acclaimed films like <em>Kitty Foyle</em> (1940) and <em>Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo</em> (1944).</p>

            <section id="the-controversy">
                <h2>The Hollywood Blacklist and the "Hollywood Ten"</h2>
                <p>Trumbo's career was abruptly derailed in 1947. Amidst the post-WWII Red Scare, he was subpoenaed to testify before the <strong>House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)</strong> regarding his alleged ties to the Communist Party.</p>

                <h3>A Stand on Principle</h3>
                <p>Trumbo, along with nine other writers and directors, refused to answer the committee's questions, citing their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly. This group became known as the <strong>Hollywood Ten</strong>. For their defiance, they were cited for contempt of Congress, fined, and sentenced to prison. Trumbo served nearly a year in a federal penitentiary.</p>

                <h3>Resilience and Redemption</h3>
                <p>Upon his release, Trumbo was <strong>blacklisted</strong> by the major Hollywood studios, rendering him unemployable under his own name. Undeterred, he continued to write prolifically under various pseudonyms. During this period, he secretly wrote the scripts for two films that would win Academy Awards for Best Story: <em>Roman Holiday</em> (1953) and <em>The Brave One</em> (1956). His credit for <em>Roman Holiday</em> was not restored until 2011, long after his death. The blacklist began to crumble in 1960 when director Otto Preminger and actor Kirk Douglas publicly credited Trumbo for the screenplays of <em>Exodus</em> and <em>Spartacus</em>, respectively, effectively ending his exile.</p>
