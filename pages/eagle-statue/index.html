                It appears there's some confusion, as the prominent "Eagle" sculpture by Joseph Nicolosi often discussed in search results is located atop the <strong class="text-gray-900">Denver City and County Building</strong>, not at the Denver West Plaza in Lakewood.

                Unfortunately, specific detailed information about the sculptor and the precise commissioning history of the Eagle statue at <strong class="text-gray-900">1400 Denver West-Marriott Blvd, Lakewood, CO 80401</strong> is not readily available in public art archives or general historical records. Many public art pieces in private developments, like plazas associated with businesses, don't always have their full histories as widely documented as city-commissioned public art.

                However, we can speak to the general symbolism of eagle statues in public spaces, which often applies to such installations:

                General Symbolism of Eagle Statues:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Eagles, particularly the bald eagle in the United States, are powerful and widely recognized symbols. In public art, they typically represent:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4 md:pl-6 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Freedom and Liberty:</strong> As a bird that soars high and is not easily constrained, the eagle embodies ideals of freedom and independence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Strength and Power:</strong> Their predatory nature and commanding presence in the sky often symbolize strength, courage, and dominance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Vision and Foresight:</strong> Eagles are known for their keen eyesight, leading to associations with clear vision, foresight, and looking towards the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Patriotism and National Identity:</strong> In the U.S., the bald eagle is the national bird and a strong emblem of patriotism, representing the nation's values and spirit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Protection and Guardianship:</strong> Their watchful nature can also symbolize guardianship and protection.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pt-4">
                It's highly probable that the Eagle statue at Denver West Plaza was commissioned by the developers or property owners of the plaza to evoke these positive and aspirational qualities, contributing to the overall aesthetic and symbolic message of the commercial space. While the specific artist and exact intent remain undocumented in accessible records, its presence likely serves to instill a sense of strength, freedom, and prominence in the area.
